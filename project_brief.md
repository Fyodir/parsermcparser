Development start date: 27th November 2018.


### Project Brief

Creation of a command line tool to efficiently create a BED file from an LRG (Locus Reference Genomic) file in .XML
format, retrieving specific elements from the file for further use (i.e. integrating into a clinical pipeline).

### Project Aims & Objectives

- Creation of a command line tool for use by clinical bioinformaticians to efficiently retrieve information from LRG
  files in XML format.
- Written in line with good scientific programming standards for the chosen language (Python 3.x.x).
- All Python code should be written in accordance with the PEP8 formatting style.
- Be correctly documented and reproducible across different systems.
- Include adequate testing to ensure proper and safe functioning of the tool.
- A README file should be included to detail usage of the program.
